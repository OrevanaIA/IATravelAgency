# Travel Agency Project

This project is a Streamlit application that acts as a travel agency assistant, helping users plan their trips.


## Interaction Flow
*PDF Upload: The user uploads PDF files via the Streamlit interface.

*PDF Processing:
    - Extracts text from each page.  
    - Generates embeddings using Azure OpenAI.


*Agent Creation: An OpenAI agent is set up to use embeddings and Bing searches.
*User Query:
    The user asks a question, and the agent searches the embeddings to return the best answer.

## Project Structure

- `env_loader.py`: Loads environment variables.
- `bing_search.py`: Performs Bing searches.
- `explore_pdf.py`: Processes PDFs and extracts their content.
- `search_embedding.py`: Generates embeddings and searches for similarities.
- `search_with_azure.py`: Coordinates searches with embeddings and Bing.
- `nuevo_agente.py`: Configures and runs the agent.
- `requirements.txt`: Necessary dependencies.
- `travelAgency.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
